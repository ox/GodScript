GodScript
==================

This is a pet project which hopes allow programmers to expel their superiority
into their code. For instance, the standard 'hello world' example:

Thou shall say 'hello world'.

Pretty sweet!

Running
------------------

Navigate into the goscript directory and run:

ruby repl.rb

and then play around. Don't abuse your godly powers yet, though.
